FindHandle was my first "popular" project which was created in 1996 using Borland Delphi.

FindHandle displays a lot of window-related run-time information to help you debug your program or find out internals about other people's program.

This was a attempt to remake it in 2009 using VC, but did not finish even as an alpha version.
